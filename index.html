  <h2>Introduction To My Inrests</h2>

  <p>Who am I, and what is this? 
    This is a website to explain to you the reader, who I am and what I do with my free time. Now, let’s start off with who I am. Obviously my name is Alexander, but I have a more intricate past than most would think. I was born in Las Vegas Nevada but moved to New Mexico in a small town where I would spend the rest of my youth. I will say, there’s not a lot for a child to do in New Mexico. So I spend my hours skating, scootering, biking, and even on the trampoline. I often went cliff jumping near my grandmothers house, and when it snowed, I would sled down the steepest hills of Ramah. After moving to a more suburban part of New Mexico, my crave for adrenaline was amped, along with my age. I was constantly outside trying to find fun things that would get my blood pumping. I would explore the tangled underground tunnels that helped with rainfall, and climb tree’s on day’s where I could be outside for hours. My determination to defeat any fear I had in my was taking over at this point I was undeniably a fearless kid. During my teenage years I would move to Pensilvania with my father where I would have to leave behind all my old trophies. I was now left with nothing, no skateboard, scooter, BMX bike, or a trampoline. From there I went through the stages of a kid where you get fat, grow a little and thin out, after I was a primed teenager. I was explosive with energy and I needed to do something instead of sitting inside playing Playstation (I was dirty.) So I finally got another skateboard and was back at it. I also got a snowboard and this added another element to my talents. However, during this time I was also enrolled in a private school where I was rigorously challenged academically and socially as I spend most my time by myself or with my siblings. This is where I had to put down the extreme sports and actually try. I was difficult adjusting, however I used what I learned in my youth and overcame whatever challenged me. I learned new methods to study and became a pretty good student. Entering my high school years, I was forced to play a sport so I would stay active. With great intellect knowing I have little to no muscle on me as well as being 5’3 at the time I chose to row. A year later, realizing that was one of my most regrettable decisions, I quit and started playing rugby where I figured my athletic ability would be more useful. I was correct in this thinking, I won a reward for the best back (position) for our junior varsity team, then was promoted to play varsity the end of my sophomore, junior, and senior year. I may be small, but Im shifty and quick as well as having great hand eye coordination from being a demon with a controller. Our team was so good that during my time playing varsity, only our varsity team was invited to play in New Orleans as well as Ireland. During this era where I was at my peak athletic ability, durability, and stamina, this is when I was also the most engulfed in skating and snowboarding. I was learning new tricks almost every week, hitter bigger spots every time all the way up to a 9 stair (Probably my biggest accomplishment as a 18 year old.) After all this time of skating, snowboarding, flipping, scootering, and biking, I had never gotten hurt besides a bruise. But everyone knows that nothing good lasts forever, then rugby put me out of commission my senior year. I first got a concussion at the end of the first season, so I could not skate or play video games. Then 2 weeks into being cleared to play again, I broke my hand during practice out of all thing. Luckily it wasn’t a horrible break and within three weeks I got it off but was recommended not to play because the bone was fragile. However, I found a love for rugby and was eager to play again already missing three weeks of the season. Also I got my cast off 2 days before our flight to Ireland so I had to play. I was fine throughout the whole trip, of course I felt the effects of having a weak forearm, but I powered through and played my heart out. After this, the very same week we got back, I sprained my ankle. This was one injury that was always so prone to happen from skating but never did. This one really hurt my sole, this is because I couldn’t skate anymore. I had hurt my left ankle which was the one I used to flick/ drag, it was one of the most important aspects of skating, and when it still hurt to land on after 6 months I almost gave up skating. But that’s not who I am, I did ankle strength training and therapy everyday on YouTube. Until finally I was able to painlessly skate again. At this point it had been so long that I had lost so much balance, drop durability, and a few tricks. This one hurt the ego as I was not as good as before but that brings me here where I have been skating at least 4 times a week since welcome week of college. Finally I can experience happiness again.</p>

<!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) It's always worth thinking about how a user navigates your site. How do you want to break up the experience of scrolling down here? How might it feel on a laptop, phone, or tablet?-->

<!--Here's another div, same as before. Note the question about putting an image behind the text. You could give this section a different class with a different background--image or color.-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h2>Mini Bio</h2>

<img src="santa.jpeg" alt="shaking hands with santa" class="center-img" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;">
<!--This image sits above your description below, but could it be the background like the hero image? You might try and modify this <div> by giving it a new class that mirrors the "hero-image" above. You can take care of that in the CSS. -->

  <p>Mini bio goes here.</p>
 </div>



    <!--To change the image for this wide screen paralax scroll, you will need change the file name in your style.css to match an image in your project folder. Look for ".paral1ax" on your style.css sheet-->

<div class="parallax">

<!--What happens if you put another div inside this parallax section? Get rid of the comment notation to find out!-->

<!-- Erase the line below this one to remove the div below from comments-->

<!--note the "style="color: white;"" in the parallax section. How would this look if we kept up the standard "textblock" style? Try it out by erasing the "style="color: white;""-->
